# Pillar of Autumn (POA)

Hello, the purpose of this project is to give the knowledge and open source code on how to build a flight computer for an amateur model rocket project.

**Our goal is to provide practical knowledge of rocket science everyone.**

In this repo you will find:
* Source code of cheap arduino flight computers.
* schematic on how to build it.
* the documentation in the code for a better understanding of the reader (diagrams and other things)

### Libraries
For running this project, you will have to some libraries for arduino : 
* [SdFat](https://github.com/greiman/SdFat) - by Bill Greiman
* [MPU6050] (https://github.com/jarzebski/Arduino-MPU6050) - by Korneliusz Jarzebski
* [MS5611](https://github.com/jarzebski/Arduino-MS5611) - by Korneliusz Jarzebski
* []()
I hope that the information in this repository is a good starting point for your science and technology enthusiasts, so if you want to help us develop this, feel free to do so, we will be very happy.
