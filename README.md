Hello, the purpose of this project is to give the knowledge and open source code on how to build a flight computer for an amateur space science project.

Our goal is to provide practical knowledge of fresh space for everyone.

In this repo you will find:
- Source code of cheap arduino flight computers.
- schematic on how to build it.
- the documentation in the code for a better understanding of the reader (diagrams and other things)

I hope that the information in this repository is a good starting point for your science and technology enthusiasts, so if you want to help us develop this, feel free to do so, we will be very happy.
